pepper: I consider Pepper the dog to be one of my greatest friends. I have known Pepper since I was in the fourth grade and she has been there for me throughout some of the hardest times in my life. Growing up with Pepper, I learned to more freely express feelings I had once found difficulty in embracing but now hold in the utmost regard such as compassion and vulnerability. I recall driving a long way from home to pick her up as she was a rescue dog with her two sisters. On the way home, Pepper started to cry when she realized she was being separated from her sisters. I began to cry too. I didnâ€™t realize it then, but this was a very important moment in my life as up until that point, I was largely inconsiderate of others. It was here I realized people other than myself are worth fighting for too. After that, I was more appreciative of my friends and family than ever. Pepper also taught me itâ€™s okay to be vulnerable. I have lived a large part of my life not seeing the value in vulnerability, seeing it as nothing more than weakness. Fortunately, Pepper showed me that vulnerability is an opportunity for growth. I see now that as long as I keep getting up, I can only become stronger and because of Pepper the dog, I know I will always have friends to empower and support me.
